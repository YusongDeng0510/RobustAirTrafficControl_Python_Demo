# Background Introduction
Air traffic control in the terminal area has always been a problem. With the fast development of air transportation industry, 
the air space has became a valuable resourses. 
A question in front of many engineers focusing on the air traffic control is how to improve to the efficiency of air space operations. 
Beyond that, the capability of air traffic controller working under high intensity is being inspected by many scholars. With that saying,
the problem I am trying to solve is _**to propose a robust algorithm that is capable for current air traffic operation, and further air traffic development**_.
